**Welcome to the CT Image analyzer tool

**About the tool

This tool allows the user to visualize and annotate 3D representations of objects that have been scanned into one or more .tif files. The tool allows for the annotation
of segments of the CT object. Additionally, multivariate Gaussian can be fitted to each sement in an attempt to estimate the dimensions and volume of each annotation.
The voxelized segments and their dimensional information can be downloaded as a .pkl and .csv files, respectfully.
